# ScrapEngine

ScrapEngine is a game engine in Visual Studio that supports graphic rendering and other features. The engine supports graphic rendering in OpenGL and Vulkan, UI building through ImGui, audio managing with irrKlang. It loads assets and scene with XML files, and has simple mouse clicking events, and a profiling tool to estimate the running time of updates and rendering.

To run the project in visual studio, please move the GameDev folder to C drive and extract the zip file. Make sure the structure should be similar to GameDev\*. GameDev\GameDev\* will not work.

This engine is a student project developed during Game Programming studies in Humber College.
